== Purpose

The main goal of this example is to send Tomcat's access logging to `stdout`, which, in the context of an application running
on OpenShift, means appending access logs to the OpenShift console, thus enabling administrators to use the central logging
facility to monitor Tomcat's activity.

== Technical details

In order to redirect Spring Boot's embedded Tomcat <<sb-conf>> logging to the OpenShift console, some work needs to be done.

- You need to set `server.use-forward-headers` to `true` in your `application.yml` file:
[source,yaml]
server:
  use-forward-headers: true


- You will need to configure your embedded Tomcat to add the `logback-access` valve by defining a provider method:

[source,java]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snowdrop/tomcat-logging-example/master/src/main/java/me/snowdrop/logging/TomcatLoggingApplication.java[tags=snippet-container]
----

- _Optional_: It is possible to register a `ServletContextListener` to log information when the servlet context is initialized / destroyed:

[source,java]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snowdrop/tomcat-logging-example/master/src/main/java/me/snowdrop/logging/TomcatLoggingApplication.java[tags=snippet-listener]
----

- _Optional_: You can also specify logging levels (e.g. `DEBUG`) for different packages (e.g. `org.apache.tomcat`) by adding
`level.<package name>` stanzas followed by the level name in `application.yml`. The name of the logging file can also be
specified using the `file` property:

[source,yaml]
logging:
  level.org.apache.tomcat: "DEBUG"
  file: "application.log"

== Deploying and interacting with the example

- Create a new project `tomcat-logging` (or whatever you want to call it):

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc new-project tomcat-logging
----

- Build and deploy the Spring Boot application using the Fabric8 Maven Plugin <<fmp>>

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean fabric8:deploy -Popenshift
----

- Retrieve the route for the application:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get route tomcat-logging-example -o jsonpath='http://{.spec.host}/greet/world'
----

- Interact with the application by navigating to the route URL in your browser and changing the last path part (`world` in
the example above) and try accessing different URLs.

- Open your OpenShift console (if you use minishift <<mini>>: `minishift console` should do it), navigate to the application
deployment: `<openshift host>/console/project/tomcat-logging/browse/dc/tomcat-logging-example` and click on
`View Log`. You should see access entries similar to:
----
192.168.64.1 - - 22/Nov/2017:15:18:44 +0000 "GET /greet/world HTTP/1.1" 200 -
192.168.64.1 - - 22/Nov/2017:15:18:45 +0000 "GET /greet/ HTTP/1.1" 404 -
